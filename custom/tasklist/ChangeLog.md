# CHANGELOG FOR TASKLIST MODULE

## Not Released
  

## 2.3
- Release note: the release branch called 2.0 is, in fact, already in v2.3.
  The release branch 2.3 will therefore bring no new features as compared with
  release 2.0 but it will ensure that the name of the release is consistent with
  the moduleâ€™s version number.

- FIX: v14 compatibility (NOCSRFCHECK + module descriptor) - *30/06/2021* - 2.3.3
- FIX: v13 compatibility (NOTOKENRENEWAL + box + GETPOST) - *07/05/2021* - 2.3.2
- FIX: en_US translation - *19/04/2021* - 2.3.1

## 2.0
- No changelog up to this point
